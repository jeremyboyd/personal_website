# Personal Website
I've had my own website since the early 1990s. I started out creating my sites in software with GUI interfaces---Microsoft Word, then Apple iWeb, then Wordpress. But around 2015 I started experimenting with the setup represented in this project: [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Basically you write pages in [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown), which allows you to combine text, analysis code, and visualization code in the same file. Then you push changes to GitHub. All changes are automatically detected by Netlify, which uses Hugo to render everything and serve it up as a smart-looking site!
