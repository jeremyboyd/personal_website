```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)

# To set up a "featured image" (appears on post list and at top of post), just put an image named "featured.jpg" in the post folder.
# Placement 1 is centered at top. Placement 2 seems to be full size, centered at top. Placement 3 is banner extending side to side on top.
# Use image: caption: to put a caption in lower right corner of image. Caption can include a hyperlink to source.
# Don't know what focal_point does.

```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
