<p>Does an individual’s socioeconomic status (SES) predict their tendency toward unethical behavior? If so, who is more likely to behave unethically–the rich or the poor? Pop culture abounds with depictions of each. For example, Walter Hill’s cult classic <em>The Warriors</em> (1979; see Figure 1) features numerous violent confrontations between New York City street gangs. This depiction is consistent with the idea that low SES individuals live in environments in which resources are relatively scarce, and so must lie, cheat, steal–and in some cases even kill–to survive.</p>

<p>Alternatively, consider Gordon Gekko from Oliver Stone’s <em>Wall Street</em> (1987; see Figure 2). Gekko commits insider trading in order to take over a company, fire its employees, and then raid their pension plan for his own benefit. Gekko’s “greed is good” philosophy is consistent with numerous examples of real-world unethical behavior among high SES individuals: bankers dupe their clients into participating in investment schemes they know are doomed to fail,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> CEOs embezzle millions to fund lavish lifestyles<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and companies attempt to increase their profitability by illegally harming the health and well-being of thousands.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h2>Are wealthier individuals more prone to unethical behavior?</h2>
<p>While empirical evidence bearing on the relationship between SES and unethical behavior is sparse, recent results from Piff and colleagues<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> demonstrate a positive association between the two. Across seven studies, the authors found that high SES consistently predicted increased unethical behavior. The very uniformity of the effect however, has suggested to some that the results shouldn’t be believed. For example, Francis<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> found that most of the Piff et al. studies had only about a 50% chance of finding a statistically significant effect. Given this power, the likelihood of getting significant results across all seven studies is quite low–around 2%. To account for this discrepancy, Francis argues that Piff et al. “may have (perhaps unwittingly) run, but not reported, additional experiments that failed to reject the null hypothesis (the file drawer problem), or they may have run the experiments in a way that improperly increased the rejection rate of the null hypothesis.”</p>

<div id="replicating-and-extending-piff-et-al.s-study-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Replicating and extending Piff et al.’s Study 1</h2>
<p>The best way to address Francis’ critique is via independent replication. The present work initiates this effort by attempting to replicate and extend Piff et al.’s Study 1. We focus on this particular study because it offers a compelling real-world demonstration of the relationship between SES and unethical behavior, and also because there are plausible explanations for the behavior of high SES participants that are largely unexplored in Piff et al., but that we attempt to address here.</p>
<p>In Study 1 Piff and colleagues observed 274 drivers as they navigated a single all-way stop intersection in the San Francisco Bay Area. Driver SES was indexed by estimating the value of drivers’ vehicles. Piff et al. found that those driving more expensive vehicles were more likely to illegally cut at the intersection–that is, they were less likely to wait their turn in the queue that formed as cars pulled up to the intersection, as required by California Vehicle Code.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Why are high SES drivers more likely to cut? While Piff et al. acknowledge that the relationship between SES and unethical behavior is complex, their central argument across all seven studies is that wealthier individuals entertain more positive attitudes towards greed. This contributes to behaviors like lying during business negotiations (Study 5), and cheating at for-profit games (Study 6). But while greed offers a relatively straightforward account of unethical behaviors that result in material gain, it seems ill-suited to explain cutting at all-way stop intersections, where drivers seem to be accruing nothing more than mere seconds. The present work explores an alternative account of the relationship between SES and illegal cutting behavior.</p>
</div>
<div id="could-high-ses-cutting-be-accidental" class="section level2">
<h2>Could high SES cutting be accidental?</h2>
<p>One interpretation of Piff and colleagues’ Study 1 is that increased cutting among high SES drivers reflects their ethics. Wealth is associated with increases in self-interested behavior<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and reduced compassion.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> These traits may lead high SES drivers to prioritize their own desire to quickly navigate intersections over both fairness to other drivers and the law.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may be that cutting has very little to do with ethics. Instead, high SES drivers may be more prone to accidental cutting due to SES-related differences in attention, as outlined in the following section. Differentiating cutting that is accidental from cutting based on ethics is important because it bears on a driver’s culpability: many ethical and legal systems assign reduced culpability in the case of accidental law-breaking–e.g., the difference between murder and manslaughter.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>How might higher SES drivers accidentally cut? Navigating all-way stop intersections requires attention to other drivers in order to determine whose turn it is to proceed. Momentary lapses of attention can cause drivers to lose track of their place in the queue, which leads to accidental cutting if they happen to go through the intersection at the wrong time. Here we suggest that high SES drivers might be more likely to cut accidentally because they devote less attention to other drivers.</p>
</div>
<div id="ses-related-differences-in-attention" class="section level2">
<h2>SES-related differences in attention</h2>
<p>The idea that higher SES individuals attend less to others has been explored in a number of studies. Whereas lower class individuals show increased attention to the social environment and specifically to other people as a way of dealing with challenges, higher class individuals are less dependent on others for survival, which leaves them relatively free to focus on and pursue their own self-interest.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> These class-based differences manifest themselves in numerous subtle ways. For example, high SES individuals show increased fidgeting and decreased gaze towards their partners during conversation,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> as well as decreased ability to read others’ emotions,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> both of which are consistent with less attention to others. Indeed, the structure of many social hierarchies encourages decreased attention to others on the part of high SES individuals. In work settings for instance, there is an asymmetry of attention such that it is more likely to be directed up the hierarchy: subordinates pay more attention to their supervisors because success at work is heavily contingent on pleasing their supervisors. In contrast, supervisors pay less attention to subordinates because their success is less strongly dependent on having detailed knowledge of their subordinates’ lives and work.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is thus possible for high SES individuals–who tend to be positioned higher in social hierarchies–to learn to attend less to others as a function of their status.</p>
</div>
<div id="attention-and-cutting" class="section level2">
<h2>Attention and cutting</h2>
<p>The asymmetry in attention to others among high versus low SES individuals might affect cutting behavior in a way that leads to accidental high SES cutting. This is illustrated in Figure 3, where the red and blue lines represent the relationship between driver SES and the probability of cutting in heavy and light traffic conditions, respectively. The dashed gray line represents the two traffic conditions combined. The gray line is a reasonable representation of what Piff et al. discovered in their Study 1 where–because they did not keep track of traffic–their results are an amalgamation of the light and heavy conditions. Distinguishing between cuts in light and heavy traffic is important because the two conditions make different demands on attention to other drivers. Specifically, navigating all-way stop intersections in heavy traffic is more difficult because the queues that form are more complex and demand attention to larger numbers of drivers.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Note in Figure 3 that the blue line (light traffic) is flat: high and low SES drivers cut at the same rates when the navigation task is relatively simple. The red line (heavy traffic) is however, positively sloped. The amount of attention that high SES drivers devote to others is not sufficient to accurately keep track of the queue that forms in heavy traffic. This leads to cutting that is accidental.</p>
<p>An alternative ethics-based hypothesis–that high SES cutting reflects normatively worse ethics among high SES drivers–predicts a different data pattern. Under the ethics hypothesis, the blue and red lines would have parallel positive slopes because high SES drivers would feel entitled to cut off other drivers regardless of whether traffic is light or heavy.</p>

<h2>The present study</h2>
<p>The present work addresses a serious critique of Piff and colleagues leveled by Francis. It does so by attempting to replicate Piff et al.’s finding of a positive correlation between SES and illegal cutting behavior at all-way stop intersections. In addition, while it is relatively common to assume that unethical behavior among wealthier individuals is related to ethical shortcomings, here we investigate the possibility that high SES cutting might instead be accidental in that it reflects class-based differences in attention.</p>
