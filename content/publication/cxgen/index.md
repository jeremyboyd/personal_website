abstract: 'The present study exposed five-year-olds (*M* = 5;2), seven-year-olds (*M* = 7;6) and adults (*M* = 22;4) to instances of a novel phrasal construction,
then used a forced choice comprehension task to evaluate their learning of the
construction. The abstractness of participants’ acquired representations of the
novel construction was evaluated by varying the degree of lexical overlap that test
items had with exposure items. We found that both child groups were less proficient
than adults, but seven-year-olds showed evidence of across-the-board generalization
whereas five-year-olds were sensitive to lexical overlap at test. This outcome is
consistent with more conservative, item-based learning of syntactic patterns in
younger children. Additionally, unlike adults and seven-year-olds, five-year-olds
showed no evidence of having mastered the novel construction’s linking rules. Thus,
younger learners are less likely to generalize abstract argument structure
constructions when exposed to the *same* systematic input as older learners.'
